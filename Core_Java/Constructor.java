//To create a copy constructor, we can first declare a constructor that takes an object of the same type as a parameter:
 class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;

        this.id = employee.id;
        this.name = employee.name;

        this.name = name;
    }
    public Employee()//default constructor
    {
        id = 10;
        name = "abc";
    }
    public void getData()
    {
        System.out.println("Id: "+this.id +" Name: "+this.name);
    }

    /*
     * Constructor is the special method of class which is automatically invoked at
     * the time of the object creation.
     * Constructor has no return type it is written as same as class name.
     * constructor is basically used to initilize instance member variables.
     * ---Types of constructor---
     * 1. Default constructor --> default constructor is constructor which has no
     * parameter's.
     * 2. Parametrized constructor --> parameterized constructor is one of
     * constructor in which user can share values while object creation.
     * 3. Copy constructor -->A copy constructor in a Java class is a constructor
     * that creates an object using another object of the same Java class.
     * 
     * Thatâ€™s helpful when we want to copy a complex object that has several fields,
     * or when we want to make a deep copy of an existing object.
     * 
     * Naming Convention--
     * it is just the type of writing class name, variable name, object name, etc.
